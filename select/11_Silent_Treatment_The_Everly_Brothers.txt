The silent treatment,
The icy shoulder,
There's nothin' colder,
It never fails!

If, from his lies and alibi-in',
You're in distress,
And to combat it you've been tryin',
But, more or less,
Without success;

A diet
Of deadly quiet
Can be a sure cure for all that ails!
Man knows it only mean disaster,
For he'll never be the master of
The silent treatment, the weapon of a woman in love!

A diet
Of deadly quiet
Can be a sure cure for all that ails!
Man knows it only mean disaster,
For he'll never be the master of
The silent treatment, the weapon of a woman in love!

Forgive him without an explanation,
With kisses instead of conversation,
As the silent treatment, the weapon of a woman in love!
