Dave Peverett - Pevwrite Music - ASCAP

I woke up last night about half past four, two police cars at my door.
Said you'd been drunk and out of control, you ran my car into a telephone pole,
Tell me baby, is it true what I heard? You never said a word.

Don't give me that silent treatment, don't give me that silent treatment,
When you do something bad, it only drives me mad - you do it every time.

Well, I said, "Hey baby, what you tryin' to do?
The things I heard about you can't be true.
Every night you're out on the town, you run my money into the ground,
"Hey baby, were you out with the boys?" You never made a noise.

Don't give me that silent treatment, don't give me that silent treatment,
When you do something bad, it only drives me mad - you do it every time.

Well you broke my heart, it was an accident, just like my money, all my love is spent.
I don't know why but I can't get through to you.

Don't give me that silent treatment, don't give me that silent treatment,
When you do something bad, it only drives me mad - you do it every time.

Well you broke my heart, it was an accident, just like my money, all my love is spent.
I don't know why but I can't get through to you.

Don't give me that silent treatment, don't give me that silent treatment,
When you do something bad, it only drives me mad - you do it every time.
Oh yeah!

{Dave - Solo}

Don't give me that silent treatment, don't give me that silent treatment,
When you do something bad, it only drives me mad - you do it every time.

Don't give me that silent treatment, don't give me that silent treatment,
When you do something bad, it always drives me mad - you do it every time.

Don't give me that - (Silent treatment) (Silent treatment)
You do something bad, it only drives me mad - you do it every time.

Don't give me that - (Silent treatment)
You do something bad, it only drives me mad - you do it every time.

Don't give me that silent treatment, don't give me that silent treatment

When you do something bad, it only drives me mad - you do it every time.

Don't give me that.
