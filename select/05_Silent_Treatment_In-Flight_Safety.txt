Now I just saw a love
It broke out of you then it broke out of me
For you it's as clear as can be
But all I can think is don't bad things come in threes

Ah
Ah ah

Ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

It's too early now to tell the song
It just starts slow then repeats in your heart
So stop in the space between the story book start and her eventual depart

'Cause all these years have made you a soldier
You're carrying the weight of two worlds on your shoulder
And I don't have that long now 'til I fall over
And your silent treatment retires
You're silent

Ah
Ah ah

Ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

Just let her die in your mind
Or she'll hold your love hostage if you keep her alive
Now the worse now comes to a close
It's all in your head now
It comes and it goes

'Cause all these years have made you a soldier
You're carrying the weight of two worlds on your shoulder
And I don't have that long now 'til I fall over
And your silent treatment retires
Your silent treatment retires
