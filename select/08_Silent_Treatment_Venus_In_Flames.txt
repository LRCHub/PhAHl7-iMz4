Out there somewhere I can't really see
Someone is waiting for me silently

It could be a case of the right place the wrong time
So speak up loudly
We could be just fine

If somebody wants me
Here I am
If somebody needs me
Here I am
If you can't find me
Here I am
Don't you deny me
Here I am

In here we can feel the tension all around
It sparks like fireworks but doesn't make a sound

If somebody wants me
Here I am
If somebody needs me
Here I am
If you can't find me
Here I am
Don't you deny meH
Here I am

So don't give me the silent treatment again
I tried hard to stick with my lost and only friend
Don't give me the silent treatment again

If somebody wants me
Here I am
If somebody needs me
Here I am
If you can't find me
Here I am
Don't you deny me
Here I am
